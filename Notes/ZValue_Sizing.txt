128 x 128 x 4 bytes for each limb

Zrs = 64K for each limb
Zis = 64K for each / limb

512 bytes for 1 row for each limb. 


Maximum of 128 limbs = 16G

For 10 Limbs = 1.25 M or 320 pages.
If we process 6 rows per batch. = 61,440 bytes per batch

For 128 Limbs = 16G or 4,096 pages

Each row is 131,072 bytes
