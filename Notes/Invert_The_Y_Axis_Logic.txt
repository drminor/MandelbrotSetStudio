Y = 10

Height = 132
ViewportHeight = 50

To get InvertedY from Y

	InvertedY = Height - ViewportHeight - Y

To get Y from Inverted Y

Starting with 
	InvertedY = Height - ViewportHeight - Y

1. Add Y to both sides
	InvertedY + Y = Height - ViewportHeight

2. Subtract InvertedY from both sides
	Y = Height - ViewportHeight - InvertedY


So...
To get InvertedY from Y is the same operation as it is
to get Y from InvertedY
