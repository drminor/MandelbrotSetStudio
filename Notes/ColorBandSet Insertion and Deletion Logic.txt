Start with a single band
	StartColor cannot be black
	EndColor must be black
	Blend Type must be 'End'
	PreviousCutoff = 0
	Cutoff = MaxIterations


Add a new Section Line, after the first band
	1. The user selects a value where the new band will begin (or the width of an existing band is halved.)
	2. The new band is assigned the Cutoff of the band before the point of insertion
	3. The previous band has its Cutoff updated to theof the band before point of insertion is set to new PreviousCutoff


First Band
	If Blend is next or end, the start color cannot be black
	PreviousCutoff = 0					>= Start
	Cutoff = 0 to Cutoff of next band	<= End

Second Band
	StartColor must be black
	Blend Type must be 'None' or 'End'
	PreviousCutoff = Cutoff of previous band
	Cutoff = MaxIterations


Add a new section Line, before the first
	1. The new band is assigned a PreviousCutoff
	2. The new band is assigned the Cutoff of the band before the point of insertion
	3. The Cutoff of the band before point of insertion is set to new PreviousCutoff
Add a new section before the second
	1. The new band is assigned a PreviousCutoff
	2. The new band is assigned the Cutoff of the band before the point of insertion
	3. The Cutoff of the band before point of insertion is set to new PreviousCutoff

First Band
	PreviousCutoff = 0					>= Start
	Cutoff = 0 to Cutoff of next band	<= End

Second Band
	PreviousCutoff = Cutoff of previous band
	Cutoff = Cutoff of previous band to Cutoff of next band

Third Band
	Blend Type must be 'None' or 'End'
	PreviousCutoff = Cutoff of previous band
	Cutoff = MaxIterations


Add a new section Line, before the first
	1. The new band is assigned a PreviousCutoff
	2. The new band is assigned the Cutoff of the band before the point of insertion
	3. The Cutoff of the band before point of insertion is set to new PreviousCutoff
Add a new section before the second
	1. The new band is assigned a PreviousCutoff
	2. The new band is assigned the Cutoff of the band before the point of insertion
	3. The Cutoff of the band before point of insertion is set to new PreviousCutoff
Add a new section before the third
	1. The new band is assigned a PreviousCutoff
	2. The new band is assigned the Cutoff of the band before the point of insertion
	3. The Cutoff of the band before point of insertion is set to new PreviousCutoff

Add a new section line after second

First Band
	PreviousCutoff = 0					>= Start
	Cutoff = 0 to Cutoff of next band	<= End

Second Band
	PreviousCutoff = Cutoff of previous band
	Cutoff = Cutoff of previous band to Cutoff of next band

Third Band
	PreviousCutoff = Cutoff of previous band
	Cutoff = Cutoff of previous band to Cutoff of next band

Forth Band
	Blend Type must be 'None' or 'End'
	PreviousCutoff = Cutoff of previous band
	Cutoff = MaxIterations


Remove the First of Four bands.

Remove the Second of Four bands.

Remove the third of Four bands.


Remove the first of Three bands

Remove the second of Three bands



Remove the first of two bands
The remaining single band
	StartColor cannot be black
	EndColor must be black
	Blend Type must be 'End'
	PreviousCutoff = 0
	Cutoff = MaxIterations
