Request Processor
	Fetch Counts
		Get MapSectionVectors from pool

	Found 
		Reader produces a MapSectionRecord /w counts byte array
		Adapter copies the contents of the MapSectionRecord's byte array
			into the MapSectionVectors
			and Creates a MapSectionResponse that takes a reference to the MapSectionVectors

		Response Processor
			Delivers the MapSectionResponse to the MapLoader
			MapLoader gets a MapSectionValues from the pool
				reads the counts byte array
				into an array of ushorts
				on the MapSectionValues
				and Creates a MapSection
			Releases the MapSectionVectors back to the pool
		
			Delivers the MapSection to the Display Control
		
			Display Control
				release the MapSectionValues back to the pool.	

	Not Found
		Get a MapSectionZVectors from the pool
		Request is created 
			that takes a reference to the MapSectionVectors
			and the MapSectionZVectors
		
		Delivers the Request to the MapSectionGenerator 

		MapSectionGenerator			
			Creates a IterationState that takes a reference to the MapSectionVectors
				--> Row
					--> Col
					<-- Row
				<-- MapSectionVectors

			Creates a response from the request
				that takes a reference to the MapSectionVectors
				and the MapSectionZVectors
				
				Removes the references to the MapSectionVectors
				and the MapSectionZVectors from the Request
				Disposes the Request.

				Return the response to the Request Processor
		
		Request Procesor
			Makes a copy of the MapSectionVectors
			Delivers it to the Request Persister
			
			Delivers the original to the Response Processor	
				--> see above for Response Processor
		
			Request Persister 
				Delivers it to the Adapter
		
				Adapter creates a MapSectionRecord
					that takes a reference to the MapSectionVectors		
				
				Returns the MapSectionVectors to the pool
