ColorMap consists of a list of targetPercentages and color values.

The targetPercentages are used to determine cut off values.
Cutoff values determine how each sample is colored. Samples that reach an iteration count of x get colored with color value y.

When the color map form is updated, the map display is requested to update it's canvas using the new cutoffs.

When the map display's coordinates are updated a new histogram is generated. 
When a new histogram is generated a new set of cutoffs are determined (from the unchanged targetPercentages) 
and the map display is then requested to update its canvas.

Coord change -> map update -> histogram update - ColorMap update -> canvas update.
The second canvas update does not generate a new histogram.

ColorMap update -> canvas update.
