	  <img align="right" src="http://archiveteam.org/images/e/e6/Archiveteam.jpg" width="200"> Formed in 2009, the Archive Team (not to be confused with the archive.org Archive-It Team) is a rogue archivist collective dedicated to saving copies of rapidly dying or deleted websites for the sake of history and digital heritage. The group is 100% composed of volunteers and interested parties, and has expanded into a large amount of related projects for saving online and digital history.
<p>
History is littered with hundreds of conflicts over the future of a community, group, location or business that were "resolved" when one of the parties stepped ahead and destroyed what was there. With the original point of contention destroyed, the debates would fall to the wayside. Archive Team believes that by duplicated condemned data, the conversation and debate can continue, as well as the richness and insight gained by keeping the materials. Our projects have ranged in size from a single volunteer downloading the data to a small-but-critical site, to over 100 volunteers stepping forward to acquire terabytes of user-created data to save for future generations.
</p><p>
The main site for Archive Team is at <a href="http://www.archiveteam.org/">archiveteam.org</a> and contains up to the date information on various projects, manifestos, plans and walkthroughs.
</p><p>
This collection contains the output of many Archive Team projects, both ongoing and completed. Thanks to the generous providing of disk space by the Internet Archive, multi-terabyte datasets can be made available, as well as in use by the <a href="http://archive.org/web/web.php">Wayback Machine</a>, providing a path back to lost websites and work. 
</p><p>
Our collection has grown to the point of having sub-collections for the type of data we acquire. If you are seeking to browse the contents of these collections, the Wayback Machine is the best first stop. Otherwise, you are free to dig into the stacks to see what you may find.

<h1>Renormalizing the Mandelbrot Escape</h1>
Anyone who has ever scratched the surface of the Mandelbrot set knows
that it involves counting to infinity.  Counting to infinity is rarely 
a light undertaking, and doing so often leaves the counter unsatisfied.
For those imaging the Mandelbrot Set, this count is usually avoided by
introducing the concepts of "maximum iterations" and an "escape radius".
The technically minded often wonder what a change in the escape radius
will do; while the artistically minded cannot help but notice that the
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200214073730/http://linas.org/art-gallery/escape/smooth.html">
number of iterations until escape is an integer, resulting in a
stair-step function that is not always visually appealing.
</a>
<p>
It is not widely known that a smooth fractional iteration count can be 
defined and easily applied.  Its definition is not at all difficult; 
the theory behind it, however, is a bit mathematical at times. 
We present one derivation, and some results below.  An alternate
derivation, using the technique of
<b>Spectral Analysis</b> of Eigenvalues in Hilbert spaces,
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200214073730/http://linas.org/art-gallery/escape/math.html">is here</a>.
Spectral analysis allows one to define a unique, smooth, invariant 
fractional iteration count that accurately describes the result of 
counting (with integers!) until infinity.  
</p><p>
The smooth iteration count has several uses, not the least of which is
the generation of nice, smooth pictures, as shown below.  Another 
utility comes through its close connection to the 
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200214073730/http://linas.org/art-gallery/escape/ray.html">Douady-Hubbard potential and external rays.</a>
</p><p>
</p><h2>The Theory</h2>
Consider the traditional iterated Mandelbrot Set equation:
<pre>      int iter_count = 0;
      float escape_radius = 20.0;
      complex Z, C;
      loop (forever) {
         Z = Z*Z +C;
         iter_count ++;
         float modulus = sqrt (ReZ*ReZ + ImZ*ImZ);
         if (modulus &gt; escape_radius) goto stop;
         if (iter_count &gt; maxiter) goto stop;
      }
   
   stop:
      color_value = colormap_lookup (iter_count);
      draw_pixel;
</pre>

It can be clearly seen that the iteration count in this traditional
algorithm is integer-valued, and that the actual value depends on the
choice of the escape radius.
<p>
The scale-dependence on the escape radius can be (partly) removed 
by differentiating the above formula with respect to the escape radius,
taking the limit to infinity, and then integrating the first term of the
resulting differential equation.  The result is a renormalized, 
scale-independent, quasi-integral-valued iteration count:

</p><pre>      m = iter_count - log (log escape_radius) /log 2
</pre>

In the above, <tt>m</tt> still changes by integer values; however, it
can be seen that it is roughly independent of the escape radius:
increasing the escape radius will on average increase the iteration count
as well, and the two will cancel each other out.
<p>
Next, let's look for the fractional iteration count. As the escaped
values of Z are iterated and diverge to infinity, the behavior
eventually becomes quite simple: <tt>Z(n) = X ^ 2 ^ n</tt> for some
value of X.  The dependence on <tt>n</tt> is simple; the dependence of Z
on n can be gotten by taking the logarithm.  In a fashion similar to
that above, we can deduce that

</p><pre>      1 &gt; m + log (log |X|) / log 2 &gt; 0
</pre>
where m is the renormalized iteration count above, and |X| is the
modulus of the complex-number valued X in the equation above.
<p>
It is now a simple matter to put these two terms together to obtain the 
fully-renormalized fractional iteration count:

</p><pre>      mu = m + frac = n + 1 - log (log  |Z(n)|) / log 2
</pre>
where <tt>n</tt> is the number of iterations needed to exceed the escape
radius, and <tt>|Z(n)|</tt> is the modulus of the iterate just after it
escapes.  That is, <tt> |Z(n)| &gt; R &gt; |Z(n-1)|</tt> were <tt>R</tt>
is the escape radius.
In the above formula, the value of <tt>mu</tt> is almost completely
independent
of the iteration count, and of the escape radius, despite the fact that
the right-hand-side of the equation is explicitly dependent on both of
these quantities.  The renormalized iteration count <tt>mu</tt> depends
only on <tt>C</tt>, and is a piecewise-continuous, differentiable function
thereof.   By using a different analysis, it can be seen that the 
renormalized iteration count <tt>mu</tt> is in fact the residue 
remaining when a pole (due to the infinite sum) is removed.  That is, 
the value of <tt>mu</tt> closely approximates the result of having 
iterated to infinity,  that is, of having an infinite escape radius, 
and an infinite max_iter.
<p>
The formula above is clearly numerically tractable, and can be
easily coded up into a computer program, without presenting any special
challenges whatsoever.  Some sample results are shown below.
</p><p>
The function above is discontinuous; the locations of the discontinuities 
are shown in the bottom-most figure below.  An estimate of the 
size of the discontinuity is easily computed.  Consider a value of 
<tt>C</tt> such that <tt>|Z(n)| = R - epsilon</tt>. Then 
</p><pre>      mu(R) = n + 1 - log log |Z(n)^2 +C| / log 2
</pre>
and 
<pre>      mu(R-2*epsilon) = n - log log |Z(n)| / log 2
</pre>
For <tt>|Z(n)| &gt; &gt; |C|</tt>, we have
<pre>      |Z(n)^2 + C| = |Z(n)|^2 * (1 + Re (C/Z(n)^2))
</pre>
thus yielding
<pre>      mu(R) - mu(R-2*epsilon) = Re ( C / (Z(n)*Z(n)) )  /  ( 2 * log |Z(n)| * log (2) )
</pre>

Although the above indicates that the error term decreases quadratically
as the escape radius is increases, it is important to note that
the error term decreases as a double-exponential of the number of iterations past
the escape radius.   That is, if instead of the <tt>mu</tt> defined above, we 
use the formula
<pre>      mu' = n + 5 - log (log  |Z(n+4)|) / log 2
</pre>
and an escape radius of 10, then the error is approximately
one part in 1.0e32 -- miniscule indeed, and with each additional
iteration shrinking by a square again.
<p>
The author has attempted vainly, and in vain, to discover 
the continuous-everywhere analogue of <tt>mu</tt>. However, 
this appears to be more difficult than it first appears, even 
as it appears to be tantalizingly simple. Note that a series 
expansion of additional correction terms is possible (these
terms contain factors of the form Re (c/z^2)) but tedious.
Indeed, the same results can be far more easily achieved simply
by iterating  few more times!  Due to the extremely rapid
convergence that is possible by iterating a few more times,
a series expansion makes no sense.

A different derivation of the above results, using regulated sums, 
lies here</a>.

</p><h2>Iterating Different Equations</h2>
The above formulas apply only to the Mandelbrot iterate.  Other iterates
require modified equations.  The corresponding results are easy to get.
If the iterated equation is of the form
<pre>Z(n) = Z(n-1) ^ p + lower-power-terms
</pre>
where <tt>^</tt> denotes exponentiation, and <tt>p</tt> is the highest
power of Z occurring in the iterated equation, then
<pre>mu = n + 1 - log (log  |Z(n)|) / log p
</pre>
<p>


<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------- -->
</p><h2>A Simplified Explanation</h2>
The following simplified and very insightful explanation is 
provided by Earl L. Hinrichs:
<p>

<i>
"Ignoring the +C in the usual formula, the orbit point grows by 
<tt>Z := Z^2</tt>.  So we have the progression 
<tt>Z, Z^2, Z^4, Z^8, Z^16,</tt> etc. Iteration counting 
amounts to assigning an integer to these values. Ignoring 
a multiplier, the log of this sequence is: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16. 
The log-log is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 which matches the integer value 
from the iteration counting. So the appropriate generalization 
of the discrete iteration counting to a continuous function 
would be the double log."
</i>
</p><p>
This simplified explanation also provides a simple insight into 
why a division by the logarithm of the power is required: consider
iterating <tt>Z := Z^3</tt>.  The log of the sequence yields
<tt>1, 3, 9, 27, 81, 243 ...</tt> and the double-log yields
<tt>0, log(3), 2log(3), 3log(3), 4log(3), ...</tt>.
</p><p>

</p><h2>The Revised Algorithm</h2>
Just to make it clear what these formulas mean, we present the revised
algorithm that employs them.  Only two lines are changed:
<pre>      int iter_count = 0;
      float escape_radius = 20.0;
      complex Z, C;
      loop (forever) {
         Z = Z*Z +C;
         iter_count ++;
         float modulus = sqrt (ReZ*ReZ + ImZ*ImZ);
         if (modulus &gt; escape_radius) goto stop;
         if (iter_count &gt; maxiter) goto stop;
      }
   
   stop:
      Z = Z*Z +C; iter_count ++;    // a couple of extra iterations helps
      Z = Z*Z +C; iter_count ++;    // decrease the size of the error term.
      float modulus = sqrt (ReZ*ReZ + ImZ*ImZ);
      float mu = iter_count - (log (log (modulus)))/ log (2.0);
      color_value = colormap_lookup (mu);
      draw_pixel (C, color_value);
</pre>
<p>

<!-- ----------------------------------------------------------- -->
</p><h2>Test Results &amp; Images</h2>
Below follow some test images illustrating the technique.
All of the images were created with the intentionally small 
max-iter of 18, resulting in spatially low-res images.  The point is
that such a low max-iter does not limit one to a mere 18 colors for the 
colormap, and that the technique really does produce a very smooth 
fractional escape value.

<p>
<img src="./Renormalizing the Mandelbrot Escape_files/iter18-2e10.gif">
<br>
<b>Radius of 2.1e10</b>. The above shows the results with a 
<tt>maxiter=18</tt> and an escape radius of 2.1e10 -- i.e. 21 billion.
<br>
<br>

<img src="./Renormalizing the Mandelbrot Escape_files/iter18-2e3.gif">
<br>
<b>Radius of 2.1e3</b>. The above shows the results with a 
<tt>maxiter=18</tt> and an escape radius of 2,100 -- two thousand, one
hundred.  Note that this picture is visually indistinguishable
from the above.
<br>
<br>

<img src="./Renormalizing the Mandelbrot Escape_files/iter18-3e0.gif">
<br>
<b>Radius of 3.1</b>. The above shows the results with a 
<tt>maxiter=18</tt> and an escape radius of 3.1 -- three.
Note that this picture is visually indistinguishable
from the above.
<br>
<br>
<img src="./Renormalizing the Mandelbrot Escape_files/diff-2e1-2e3.gif">
<br>
<b>Error Term</b>. The above image is a difference between the 
r=20 and r=2000 images, magnified by one-thousand.  Clearly, it appears
that the error is bounded by approx one part in a thousand for escape
radii in this range.  Visually speaking, the error term is invisible to
the naked eye.
